Soundcloud Challenge: **Follower Maze**

- implemented purely in Golang, without usage of any additional libraries

**Requirements**
 - golang version >=1.12
 - working gopath (``$GOPATH/bin`` has to be setup in ``$PATH``)
 - project directory ``/followermaze`` placed in ``go/src``

**To Run**
 
 open terminal in the ``/followermaze`` repository and run:
 - the script: ``./maze_server.sh``

or
 - a command ``go build followermaze``. 
 The runnable binary will be generated ``./followermaze.exe`` and can be called.
 
 **To Test**
 
 - run a command ``go test followermaze``
 
 Test suite is incomplete at the moment and checks partial logic.
